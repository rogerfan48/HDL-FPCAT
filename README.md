## Project - Sophomore Fall - Hardware Design Lab - FPCAT
- This repository contains all the codes, sources and documentation of our Final Project from the Hardware Design Lab course during my sophomore year's first semester.
- FPCAT is a game inspired by Battle Cat and developed by us using Verilog (some SystemVerilog) on Vivado with mouse input and VGA output. **Please see the report below for details.**
- For my HDL coursework, including all my exercises, assignments, and laboratory work, please refer to this repository: [Course-Soph1-HDL](https://github.com/rogerfan48/Course-Soph1-HDL)
